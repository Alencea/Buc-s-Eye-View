Mandatory Features
 These are essential for the game to function as designed, and must be implemented first.

1. Score System:
    - Top 10 Scores: Track the top 10 high scores across sessions.
    - Score Calculation: Calculate score based on the time remaining divided by the number of correct guesses.
    - Initials Collection: After reaching a top 10 score, prompt the player to enter their initials for the leaderboard.

    - 5-Minute Timer: Players have 5 minutes to guess all images. Track time countdown and calculate penalties for running out of time.

3. One Guess per Image:
